# T.L. Swetnam, Ph.D. 

## About Me 

Tyson Swetnam is a Research Associate Professor of Geoinformatics at The University of Arizona (UArizona) and the Director of Open Science in the [Institute for Computation and Data-enabled Insight](http://datainsight.arizona.edu/){target=_blank}. Dr. Swetnam earned graduate degrees from the UArizona's [College of Agriculture, Life, and Environmental Science (CALES)](https://cales.arizona.edu/){target=_blank} in Watershed Management (ecohydrology and disturbance ecology) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) prior to his faculty appointment. He holds joint appointments in the [School of Natural Resources and Environment](https://nature.arizona.edu/tyson-swetnam){target=_blank} and the [BIO5 Institute](https://bio5.org){target=_blank}. Dr. Swetnam's research covers a broad range of science and cyberinfrastructure applications where he collaborates with a diverse group of data science oriented projects in both Life and Earth Sciences. Dr. Swetnam is Co-principal investigator of [CyVerse](https://cyverse.org){target=_blank}, the largest ever investment in cyberinfrastructure for the Life Sciences by The National Science Foundation; he also leads and co-leads multiple extramural research awards focused on data science, remote sensing of the environment, artificial ingelligence and machine learning.

As a research professor, I am not required to teach credit courses at the University. Currently, we teach workshops on foundations of open science and digital literacy via the Learning Center.

My team and I are members of [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) and [Research Bazaar Arizona](https://researchbazaar.arizona.edu/).
