### [Research](./current_projects/)

My personal research interests include applied use of cyberinfrastructure for geospatial analysis, data science best practices (for reproducible research), as well as metadata and ontology (information science).

### [Teaching](./teaching/)

As a research professor, I am not required to teach credit courses at the University.

I help to teach workshops on foundational open science skills, and containers via the [CyVerse Learning Institute](https://learning.cyverse.org) 

I am also an active member of [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) and [Research Bazaar Arizona](https://researchbazaar.arizona.edu/)
