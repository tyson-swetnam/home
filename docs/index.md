### [Research](./current_projects/)

My personal research interests include applied use of cyberinfrastructure for geospatial analysis, data science best practices (for reproducible research), as well as metadata and ontology (information science).

### [Teaching](./teaching/)

As a research professor, I am not required to teach credit courses at the University.

I help to teach workshops on foundational open science skills, and containers via the [CyVerse Learning Institute](https://learning.cyverse.org) 

I am also an active member of [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) and [Research Bazaar Arizona](https://researchbazaar.arizona.edu/)

### Previous work experience

My first career was as a wildland firefighter. I worked for the US DOI National Park Service as a forestry technician for Saguaro National Park from 2002-2005. 
Later, during my Ph.D. program, I worked as a Fire Management Specialist for the USDA Forest Service Coronado National Forest Supervisor's Office from 2008-2012.

My graduate research focused on the applications of [dendrochronology](https://ltrr.arizona.edu) and dendroecology, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and Remote Sensing for Watershed Management. I used those data to analyze disturbance regimes and carbon in western forested ecosystems. 

That experience working on new sensor and data types led me into my career in data science and geoinformatics.
