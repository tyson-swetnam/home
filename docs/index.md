### Research

My personal research interests include applied use of cyberinfrastructure for geospatial analysis, data science best practices (for reproducible research), as well as metadata and ontology (information science).

I teach workshops to other researchers via the CyVerse Learning Institute. I am an active member of the Carpentries and Research Bazaar Arizona.

### Previous work experiences

My first career was in wildland firefighting. 
 
I spent summer seasons working for the US DOI National Park Service as a forestry technician, taking graduate courses in the fall and spring. Later, during my Ph.D. program, I worked as a Fire Management Specialist for the USDA Forest Service.

When I returned for my graduat work, I got a Master’s and Ph.D. in "Watershed Management" a sub-discipine of natural resources and environmental.

My work focused on the application of dendrochronology and dendroecology with a strong emphasis on Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing of large data sets. 
 
 Those experiences helped lead me to my current position in data science and informatics.
