    * The slide rule is invented by the mathematician William Oughtred around 1620 (rectangular) and 1630 (circular), based on the concept of mathematical logarithms, which were discovered by John  Napier a decade earlier. <Cajori, F. (1908). Notes on the history of the slide rule. The American Mathematical Monthly, 15(1), 1-5.> Slide rules continue to be used for engineering, mathematics, and scientific research well into the 1980s. 

    * Ada Lovelace writes the first algorithm around 1842, describing an Analytical Engine to compute Bernoulli numbers for Charles Babbage's computational engine. Notably, the machine is never built, its impact is not realized for another hundred years.

    * In the 1930's Alan Turing devises the "Turing Machine" and is employed by the British Government to break the Nazi's Enigma code boxes. His invention leads to the creation of the first General Purpose Computers.

    * In 1951 the first commercial computer, UNIVAC (Universal Automatic Computer) is put into production in the 1950s with units purchased by commercial companies and research universities. By 1953 the first computer science degree program is offered at University of Cambridge, and by 1962 Purdue has formed the first computer science department. 

    * In the [1950s scientists proposed definitions of AI](https://web.archive.org/web/20070826230310/http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/history/dartmouth/dartmouth.html){target=_blank}. In 1963, [Computers and Thought](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/601134){target=_blank} was published, highlighting 20 seminal papers on AI. 

    * The [FORTRAN (Formula Translation)](https://fortran-lang.org/en/){target=_blank} programming language is created in 1957 by John Backus team at IBM. Critically, FORTAN shortened the process of programming and made computer programming more accessible. Over 60 years later, modern FORTRAN is still one of the most popular languages for [numerical simulation modelling in high performance computing](https://github.com/lanl?language=fortran){target=_blank}.

    * In the 1980s personal computers are released by Apple and IBM. Computing enters the home and the office. 

    * Microsoft's Office for Windows makes word processing and tabular spreadsheets available for most business and scientific research

    * In the 1990s the Internet is expanded beyond University campuses into homes and businesses. Search Engines are developed, with Google taking command in the late 1990s with its patented ranked search which provides better results in less time.

    * Apple releases the iPhone, an all-in-one device which has a high quality camera, touch screen, telephone, and integrated operating system with personal computing.

    * In 2018 LLMs are released by major tech companies (Microsoft, Google, Meta (Facebook)). 
    
    * In late 2022, OpenaI's ChatGPT-3 is released. Within two months has over 100 million active users.
