# AI 4 Ag

In the last four months a new technology has been grabbing online headlines: [OpenAI's :simple-openai:](https://openai.com){target=_blank} chat bot [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com){target=_blank}. ChatGPT is part of a growing family of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models known as "Large Language Models" or LLMs [(:simple-wikipedia:)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model){target=_blank}. Every major technology software company is now racing to build competitors to OpenAI or to leverage 'extensions' and 'plugins' which use one of several newly featured LLMs.

Without spending too much time explaining the why or how LLMs work, we can confidently state that LLMs are poised to radically transform our workforce. The expectation for managers and researchers working in computational spaces is that some form of AI will be integrated into your favored productivity software or research software in the coming months to years.

There are already tools, like ChatGPT, which can be used to improve performance and reduce the amount of time it takes to complete conventional tasks like writing, editing, graphic design, or software writing.

Of specific interest for researchers working in agricultural science are tools for improving general productivity, writing code, and using computer vision.

## What is AI and why should you care?

There have been a series of transformative technological events in human history which brought us to today's AI.

The latest AI which are talked about the most include Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative Pretrained Transormers (GPTs) trained on large volumes of data (e.g., the internet, Wikipedia, scholarly research publications, print and news media).

LLMs are now used in Microsoft's new Bing search engine and by Google's BARD. These next-generation search tools can hold conversations with you and help you to research information more efficently and effectively.

??? Info "Fun Facts"

    Humans are powered by our metabolism, which works out to about ~12 watts of electrical energy per brain :material-head-lightbulb: and 80 watts for our base metabolic rate, the same as an incandescent lightbulb :material-lightbulb-on:. 
    
    Current LLMs require training on many thousands of GPUs for many months, each requiring thousands of watts of energy. 
    
    The technological ability to create a silicon brain (think: the androids of West World or Star Trek) or biologically artifical beings (think: the 10 foot tall alien Na'vi avatars from the Avatar movie franchise) which operate on a similar energy budget is reserved to the realm of science fiction, for now.

        Be more specific about your suggestion "Optimal planting schedules: Farmers can use the platform to analyze historical weather data, crop yields, and other relevant factors to determine the best time to plant their crops." 

    !!! Success ":simple-openai: Response #2"

        Optimal planting schedules can be determined using the OpenAI API and ChatGPT platform by integrating various data sources and using machine learning algorithms to make predictions. Here's a more specific approach:

        Data collection: Farmers can gather historical weather data (such as temperature, rainfall, and humidity), crop yield records, soil data (including nutrient levels and soil type), and information on pest and disease outbreaks. This data can be collected from personal records, open data sources, or purchased from third-party providers.

        Data preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the collected data to ensure it is in a format that can be easily used by the platform. This may involve removing any outliers, filling in missing data, and normalizing the data.

        Feature selection: Identify the most relevant factors that influence the planting schedule. This could include variables such as average temperature during the growing season, precipitation patterns, and soil conditions.

        Model development: Train a machine learning model using the preprocessed data and selected features. The model could be a regression, decision tree, or even a neural network, depending on the complexity of the problem and the available computational resources.

        Model validation: Validate the model by testing its performance on a separate dataset that was not used during the training process. This will help ensure that the model is accurate and not overfitting the data.

        Prediction and analysis: Use the trained model to predict the optimal planting schedule based on the current and projected weather conditions, as well as other relevant factors. Analyze the results to identify the best time to plant crops to maximize yield and minimize risk.

        Implementation and monitoring: Apply the optimal planting schedule in the field and continuously monitor the crop performance. Update the model with new data to improve its accuracy and make better predictions in the future.

        By following this approach, farmers can make data-driven decisions on when to plant their crops, which can lead to increased yields and more efficient use of resources.
