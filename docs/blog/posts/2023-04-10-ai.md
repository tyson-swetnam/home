# Meet your new personal assistant, Artificial Intelligence

*"Have you used [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat){target=_blank}?"* might be the most frequently asked question in faculty meetings and water cooler conversations in the first four months of 2023. ChatGPT is five months old. It exceeded 100 million users [two months after its initial public release](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/), the fastest in internet history.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) [(:simple-wikipedia:)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model){target=_blank}, like ChatGPT, are disrupting classrooms [(:simple-newyorktimes:)](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/02/learning/students-chatgpt.html){target=_blank}, passing every major standardized test with flying colors [(OpenAI :simple-arxiv:)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2303.08774){target=_blank}, and casting a long shadow over the workplace [(Eloundou et al. :simple-arxiv:)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2303.10130){target=_blank}.

While ChatGPT and its relatives have recieved deserved skepticism about their factual inaccuracies [(:simple-newyorktimes:)](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/14/technology/openai-new-gpt4.html){target=_blank} and criticism around their propensity for misogyny and racism when misused [(:simple-cnn:)](https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/18/politics/ai-chatgpt-racist-what-matters/index.html){target=_blank}, they will inevitably impact our lives for the better and the worse over coming months and years. 

It bears mentioning: these are likely the early days of a Gartner Hype Cycle [(:simple-wikipedia:)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner_hype_cycle){target=_blank}. Signs do suggest however that a new era is about to begin where AI enters our classrooms, work spaces, and homes, whether you welcome it or not. 

## Should you adapt or resist AI in your life?

Despite recent outcries from wealthy tech entrepreneurs and scholars asking for a six month 'pause' on the training of large AI models [(:fontawesome-solid-file-signature:)](https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/){target=_blank}, the horse has already left the barn. The potential windfall profit and benefit of network effects [(:simple-wikipedia:)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect){target=_blank} from being the first to market with the most powerful and advanced AI is driving competition amongst tech giants with hundreds of billions of dollars being invested in the next year alone.

Popular culture is rife with science-fiction tales of AI running amok, subjugating humanity, or causing planetary armageddon. Ironically, such stories are typically allegorical or social commentary of our very real history of colonialism, genocide, environmental collapse & unchecked capitalism giving rise to western civilization, rather than speculative fictions. Will AI become 'evil' on its own or will people be the ones who create and train it to kill? I think the latter.  

??? Tip "The Ethics of Artificial Intelligence"

    * [A Unified Framework of Five Principles for AI in Society](https://doi.org/10.1162%2F99608f92.8cd550d1){target=_blank} 

    * [Ethics of Artificial Intelligence (:simple-wikipedia:)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence){target=_blank}

There can be very real unintended consequences in developing machine learning techniques. Recent examples in otherwise benevolent research include: [ML-powered drug discovery being reverse-trained to case harm by creating novel deadly toxins](https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/deliberately-optimizing-harm){target=_blank} and advanced AI technology being repurposed for [warfare](https://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2023/3/24/ukraine-a-living-lab-for-ai-warfare){target=_blank} and for [terrorism :united_nations: :fontawesome-regular-file-pdf:](https://www.un.org/counterterrorism/sites/www.un.org.counterterrorism/files/malicious-use-of-ai-uncct-unicri-report-hd.pdf){target=_blank}. Yet absolute prohibitions on the development of AI could result in worse outcomes for humanity in light of its potential benefits and facilitated solutions to other social and environmental challenges it faces. 

Defering to learn about, or engage with this technology may likewise result in negative consequences for you, for your students, and your research. 

## What kind of AI do you you need to know about?

Machine Learning models have been in action for many years now. However, there are several types of AI being talked about online and in the news which all come from the same family of so-called LLMs. 

LLMs rely upon pre-trained neural networks built from large corpus of data (i.e., the internet: Wikipedia, libraries of digital books, all scientific publications, and print news) amounting to billions of pages of text and hundreds of terabytes of data. LLMs can also be trained on imagery, video, or audio using self-supervised learning to produce artificial imagery, videos, music, and voices. 

The first LLM from OpenAI was released in 2018. LLMs now power [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat){target=_blank}, [DALL·E](https://labs.openai.com/){target=_blank}, and Microsoft's improved [Bing](https://www.bing.com/){target=_blank} search engine. Google's [LaMDA](https://blog.google/technology/ai/lamda/){target=_blank} LLM powers [BARD](https://bard.google.com/){target=_blank}, its own entry into AI chat. Meta's [LLaMa](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/){target=_blank} was publicly released on GitHub and is now used in numerous [open source chat projects](https://github.com/search?q=llama+chat&type=repositories&s=stars&o=desc){target=_blank}. Meta has also released a utilitarian computer vision platform called [Segment Anything Model](https://segment-anything.com/){target=_blank}, which can isolate objects in any image.

Access to libraries of pre-trained models and to training data for further model 'tuning' are critical to the continued development of AI. Platforms like GitHub are a critical aspect of the AI ecosystem, providing the version controlled code and a space to share ideas. 

Another critical pillar of this AI revolution is the American start-up [:hugging: HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/){target=_blank}. AI developers use HuggingFace to publish their Apps and to share their pre-trained models. As of April 2023, HuggingFace hosts over [173,000 free AI models](https://huggingface.co/models){target=_blank}, the most of any platform.

    **Stable Diffusion**

    **Tuning**

    **Weights** - are the value by which a model multiplies another value. Weights are typically determined by the proportional value of the importance of the parameters. Weights signify the value of a specific set of parameters after self-training.

## How will AI be used in the workplace?

Early findings (by the creators of these technologies) suggest ChatGPT and LLMs will impact over 80% of the workforce, with 20% of the workforce seeing over 50% penetration of AI technology into their work [(:simple-arxiv:)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2303.10130){target=_blank}. 

Incorporating LLMs and GPT for productivity tasks (writing, editing, outlining) can save advanced users over 50% of their effort [(:simple-arxiv:)](http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4375283){target=_blank}.

Likewise using AI co-programmers like GitHub's [:octicons-copilot-48: CoPilot](https://github.com/features/preview/copilot-x){target=_blank} powered by [OpenAI :simple-openai:](https://github.com/orgs/openai/repositories){target=_blank} GPT-4 can result in up to 58% improved performance in writing and generating code [(:simple-arxiv:)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2302.06590){target=_blank}.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In the next 5 years, AI won&#39;t steal people&#39;s job. People using AI will.</p>&mdash; Bruno Sánchez-Andrade Nuño (@brunosan) <a href="https://twitter.com/brunosan/status/1642896603001257985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 3, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

??? Question "Should you be worried an AI is going to steal your job or make that diploma worthless?"

    Humanity is still decades away from an [Artificial General Intelligence :simple-wikipedia:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence){target=_blank} or Artificial Super Intelligence which can learn as humans and animals do. 

    Your future career will most likely leverage AI as a digital assistant. What will be critical is staying grounded by bedrock foundations around the ethical applications of AI.

**General Productivity**

ChatGPT and its relatives are integrated into popular productivity software. Microsoft [announced integration of OpenAI](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/){target=_blank} and :octicons-copilot-48: CoPilot into :simple-microsoftoffice: Microsoft Office 365, along with the new [:material-microsoft-bing: Bing](https://www.bing.com/){target=_blank}.

Google has likewise [announced the integration of LaMDA](https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/generative-ai){target=_blank} into :simple-gmail: GMail, :material-google-drive: Drive Docs and :simple-googlesheets: Sheets.

## How can you use AI in the classroom?

ChatGPT's `GPT-3.5-turbo` and `GPT-4` models can write essays and pass the most advanced knowledge assessments [(OpenAI :simple-arxiv:)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2303.08774){target=_blank}. The most recent (and lucrative) innovation in academia: online education, now faces serious concerns about the ability to effectivley assess students' ability remotely [(Susnjak :simple-arxiv:)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2212.09292){target=_blank}. 

Modifying coursework to avoid assessment techniquess where ChatGPT accels, or using [bots to detect ChatGPT generated content](https://platform.openai.com/ai-text-classifier){target=_blank} are ultimately futile efforts. Rather than falling into the latest cheating arms race, why not adapt to allow the use of ChatGPT and other AI frameworks?  

Advocates for integrating ChatGPT into educational curricula [(:simple-newyorktimes:)](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/12/technology/chatgpt-schools-teachers.html){target=_blank} point out that by going-with-the-flow and integrating ChatGPT into curricula, we will create a more modern workforce who are empowered by their AI assistants. Admittedly, I am of this philosophical school.

## How should graduate students and postdoctoral researchers be advised in the use AI?

Training the next generation of researchers to use AI effectively and <u>ethically</u> is one of the most important aspects of being a graduate mentor. I personally feel inclined to ensure my students first have the appropriate access to these platforms, and second that they have a full understanding of the ethical implications toward their education and toward research and software engineering. 

Platforms like ChatGPT may very well become the primary mentor of our graduate students and postdoctoral research corps. Unlike advisors, they are available 24-7 to answer virtually any question or solve any problem.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I will no longer approve graduate student dissertation proposals or dissertations unless they used ChatGPT or a similar AI to help them write part it!

I strongly encourage faculty and research teams to explore how they can incorporate LLMs like GPT-4 into their daily work in the context of developing their own [Research Objects](https://doi.org/10.1038/npre.2010.4626.1){target=_blank}.

??? Tip "ChatGPT :simple-awesomelists: Awesome Lists"

    There is an ever changing meta-list of :simple-awesomelists: Awesome lists curated around ChatGPT plugins and extensions.

    [:simple-github: search: `chatgpt+awesome`](https://github.com/search?q=awesome-chatgpt+&type=repositories&s=stars&o=desc){target=_blank}

    Check out the lists around:

    * ChatGPT Prompts
    * API plugins, extensions, & applications

**Use ChatGPT to teach yourself how to code in a new language**

Applying progressively refined prompts or provide similar examples of what type of code you are working with. Refined prompts help ChatGPT to better explain what the code does, why it is dysfunctional, and how it can be corrected. 

ChatGPT can even be prompted to act as a [Linux Terminal](https://www.engraved.blog/building-a-virtual-machine-inside/){target=_blank}.

**Become an AI-powered paired-programming team**

Use version control systems, like `git` (GitHub, GitLab) to track changes in your code. By leveraging GitHub's free [Education accounts for students and researchers](https://education.github.com/){target=_blank}, you can gain access to OpenAI powered [CoPilot](https://github.com/features/copilot){target=_blank} which is natively integrated into GitHub's virtual machine [CodeSpaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces){target=_blank} environments. 

The CoPilot AI-paired-programmer can assist you in developing code in any programming language, or in converting legacy code from older languages into more modern ones.

**Literature Review and meta analyses**

ChatGPT has been much derided for its innacuracy and capacity to generate factually incorrect information. There are however other tools, like [:hugging: Paper-QA](https://github.com/whitead/paper-qa){target=_blank} which only rely upon the textual information provided to them (PDFs) to generate contextual answers with citations.

**Image Analysis**

??? Tip "Image Generation & Segmentation Models"

    **Stable Diffusion**

    [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/CompVis){target=_blank} was released by the [CompVis Lab](https://ommer-lab.com/){target=_blank} group at [Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich](https://www.lmu.de/de/index.html){target=_blank}. 

    Stable Diffusion models are available via [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/CompVis){target=_blank}

    Diffusion models have two modes, forward and reverse. Forward diffusion adds random noise until the image is lost. Reverse diffusion uses Markov Chains to recover data from a Gaussian distribution, thereby gradually removing noise.

    Stable Dffusion relies upon [Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) (:simple-arxiv:)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2112.10752){target=_blank}

    **Example Image Generation Models**

    [DALL·E](https://labs.openai.com/){target=_blank} uses GPT to create imagery from natural language descriptions

    [MidJourney](https://www.midjourney.com/){target=_blank} uses a proprietary machine learning technology, believed to be stable diffusion, along with natural langauge descriptions in the same way as DALL·E and Stable Diffusion models. MidJourney is only available via Discord, and requires a subscription for premier access after a 30-day free trial.

    [Segment-Anything (Meta)](https://segment-anything.com/){target=_blank}, [paper :simple-pdf:](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2304.02643){target=_blank}, is a recently released image and video segmentation technology that allows you to 'clip' a feature from an image with a single click.
