# GPT-101 revisited   

I spent a good part of my winter break updating the first [GPT-101](https://tyson-swetnam.github.io/intro-gpt){target=_blank} workshop I co-designed in 2023. 

The way to write prompts has not changed dramatically, but the GPT landscape has exploded. There are so many competing resources fighting for your $12 to $30 / month subscription, its hard to keep track. Some highlights:

* Google Bard became :simple-googlegemini: Gemini,

* GPTs can be [counted by the dozen](https://tyson-swetnam.github.io/intro-gpt/daily-productivity/#choosing-the-right-gpt).

* Fever dream video generation with OpenAI [Sora](){target=_blank}: [![sora](assets/sora_professor.gif)]()

I was shocked to discover (with the help of some of the newest and most resource intenstive AI like :simple-googlegemini: Google Gemini Deep Research and :simple-openai: ChatGPT o1) the sheer number of GPTs specialized for chat, scholarly research, writing code, or image and even video generation are all for sale.

## Ethics of AI

A lot changed over the last two years. 

AI is now the [ever largest financial investment for venture capital](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/01/11/80-billion-reasons-why-these-2-top-artificial-inte/){target=_blank} and is leading the tech industry, and society more broadly into an uncertain future.   

Energy demands for AI are also [sky rocketing](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/ai-has-high-data-center-energy-costs-there-are-solutions){target=_blank}. These demands will likely lead to increased prices for consumers.

AI gathered up [two Nobel Prizes](https://www.nobelprize.org/all-nobel-prizes-2024/){target=_blank} in Physics & Chemistry back in October, revealing the increasing recognition for computer science over the classical sciences. 

## Ethical AI

The field of [Robotics](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/industries/robotics/){target=_blank} and autonomous systems have begun a new AI-fueled renaissaince. Generative AI based on [physics-based foundation models](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/cosmos/) and [synthetic training data]() are enabling self-driving vehicles and gymnastic androids toward entering the civilian workforce and military spaces. 

A long shadow of Asimov's [Three Laws of Robotics](https://tyson-swetnam.github.io/intro-gpt/ethics/#history){target=_blank} looms. In particular, human-piloted drone-enabled warfare drives weapon innovation, while autonomous systems inch closer toward operational deployment on the battlefields of Ukraine and Russia.
