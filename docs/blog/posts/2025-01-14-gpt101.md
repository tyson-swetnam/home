# GPT-101 revisited   

I spent a good part of my winter break updating the first [GPT-101](https://tyson-swetnam.github.io/intro-gpt){target=_blank} workshop I co-designed in 2023. 

The ways in which we write prompts have not changed much, but the AI landscape [has exploded](https://tyson-swetnam.github.io/intro-gpt/daily-productivity/#choosing-the-right-gpt){target=_blank}. I am staggered by the sheer number of GPTs now available for chat, scholarly research, writing code, or image and video generation (see GIF below). There are [many competing platforms](https://tyson-swetnam.github.io/intro-gpt/ai_landscape/#table-prices-of-services-last-checked-122024){target=_blank} all fighting for $20 a month subscription fees.

## Ethics of AI

Questions continue to be asked about how these AI are created and [what data they are trained upon](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/12/18/1108796/this-is-where-the-data-to-build-ai-comes-from){target=_blank}. There is uncertainty about how they are being applied in our daily lives at all levels of society, from [the classroom](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2024/09/professor-tailored-ai-tutor-to-physics-course-engagement-doubled/){target=_blank}, to [the courtroom](https://chatgptiseatingtheworld.com/2024/08/27/master-list-of-lawsuits-v-ai-chatgpt-openai-microsoft-meta-midjourney-other-ai-cos/){target=_blank}. 

Will AI result in more inequality, or will it lift up the societal or economically disadvantaged?     

What we know already:

* AI is now the [ever largest financial investment for venture capital](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/01/11/80-billion-reasons-why-these-2-top-artificial-inte/){target=_blank}. 

* Energy demands for AI are [sky rocketing](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/ai-has-high-data-center-energy-costs-there-are-solutions){target=_blank}. These demands will likely lead to increased prices for consumers.

* AI gathered up [two Nobel Prizes](https://www.nobelprize.org/all-nobel-prizes-2024/){target=_blank} in Physics & Chemistry back in October, revealing the increasing recognition for computer science over the classical sciences. 

## Ethical AI

[Robotics](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/industries/robotics/){target=_blank} and autonomous systems are entering a new AI-fueled Renaissance. 

[Physics-based AI foundation models](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/cosmos/) and [synthetic training data]() are enabling self-driving vehicles and gymnastic androids are backflipping into the civilian workforce and military spaces. 

The long shadows of Isaac Asimov and his [Three Laws of Robotics](https://tyson-swetnam.github.io/intro-gpt/ethics/#history){target=_blank} loom large.

While [human-piloted drone-enabled warfare](https://www.npr.org/2024/12/24/nx-s1-5237354/secret-ukraine-drone-command-post-russia-war){target=_blank} drives weapons innovation on the battlefields of Ukraine and Russia, fully autonomous systems inch closer toward operational deployment.

## AI for All

The [Magnificent 7 Stocks](https://www.fool.com/ext-content/one-stock-that-might-be-in-the-next-magnificent-7){target=_blank} -- the most valuable companies in the world are all betting their portfolios on AI. In the US, [hundreds of billions of dollars](https://apnews.com/article/trump-ai-openai-oracle-softbank-son-altman-ellison-be261f8a8ee07a0623d4170397348c41){target=_blank} are being invested into new data centers with the promise of [curing cancer](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-mrna-vaccine-cure-cancer-ai-2018701){target=_blank}. 

While these Fortune companies keep their AI models private, a Chinese start-up [DeepSeek](https://www.deepseek.com/){target=_blank} has released its models as open-source. Trained on commodity hardware, DeepSeek can can run on PCs or cellular phones, with performance that rivals the best models from Google, Meta, or OpenAI.

Perhaps this means that AI will continue to be available to even those without means. While investors are [targeting autonomous systems (robotics and androids)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/business/dealbook/nvidia-ai-robots.html){target=_blank}, [drug development](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-deepmind-isomorphic-alphafold-3-ai-model/){target=_blank} and its treatment applications, data extraction from consumers and social media in the USA continues to be an unregulated space in need of [legal protections](https://tyson-swetnam.github.io/intro-gpt/ethics/#table-2-international-ai-agreements){target=_blank} (i.e., [AI Bill of Rights](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-bill-of-rights){target=_blank}) and new AI strategy from state and federal government.
