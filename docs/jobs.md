# Employment

My team currently includes data scientists in bioinformatics and geoinformatics. 

I mentor postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduates on our funded projects.

We are always looking for good people who are interested in open science, digital literacy, and research using cyberinfrastructure.
