### Foundational experiences

My first career was as a wildland firefighter. I worked for the US DOI National Park Service as a forestry technician for Saguaro National Park from 2002-2005. 
Later, during my Ph.D. program, I worked as a Fire Management Specialist for the USDA Forest Service Coronado National Forest Supervisor's Office from 2008-2012.

My graduate research focused on the applications of [dendrochronology](https://ltrr.arizona.edu) and dendroecology, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and Remote Sensing for Watershed Management. I used those data to analyze disturbance regimes and carbon in western forested ecosystems. 

That experience working on new sensor and data types led me into my career in data science and geoinformatics.
