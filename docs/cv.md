### Foundational experiences

My first career path was with the US Department of Interior at Saguaro National Park (2002-2005). I worked as a wildland firefighter (Forestry Technician) on their backcountry wilderness firecrew and later on their Fire Use Module.

That experience led me to a master's degree working with Dr. Peter Brown and his [Rocky Mountain Tree Ring Research Laboratory](http://rmtrr.org/){target=_blank}, using [dendrochronology techniques](https://ltrr.arizona.edu/about/treerings){target=_blank} and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) under [D. Phil Guertin](https://profiles.arizona.edu/person/dpg) at UArizona [reconstructing historical fire regimes in Utah](https://doi.org/10.1071/WF08001){target=_blank}.

Later, during my Ph.D. program I worked for the US Department of Agriculture in the Coronado National Forest Supervisor's Office (2008-2012) as a Fire Management Specialist. My doctoral research was inderdisciplinary around [restoration ecology](https://nature.arizona.edu/donald-falk){target=_blank}, GIS and remote sensing in [watershed management and ecohydrology](https://nature.arizona.edu/graduate/watershed-management-ecohydrology){target=_blank}. 

My [dissertation :fontawesome-solid-file-pdf:](https://www.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/pubs/48047){target=_blank} relied on remote sensing and field plot data to analyze disturbance regimes and carbon budgets of western US forest ecosystems . 

That work with large remotely sensed data sets led me to my current career in data science and geoinformatics.
