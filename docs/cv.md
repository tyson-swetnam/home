### Foundational experiences

In my first career I worked as a seasonal wildland firefighter for the US Department of Interior's National Park Service as a forestry technician at the Saguaro National Park from 2002-2005. 

During my Ph.D. program I worked as a Fire Management Specialist for the US Department of Agriculture's Forest Service in the Coronado National Forest Supervisor's Office from 2008-2012.

My graduate research focused on the applications of [dendrochronology](https://ltrr.arizona.edu), [restoration ecology](https://nature.arizona.edu/donald-falk), Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing, in [watershed management and ecohydrology](https://nature.arizona.edu/graduate/watershed-management-ecohydrology). 

I used those data to analyze [disturbance regimes and carbon in western forested ecosystems](https://www.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/pubs/48047). 

That experience working on new sensor and data types led to my career in data science and geoinformatics.
