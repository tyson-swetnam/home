# Old lab journals and webpages

Before transitioning to GitHub I used an Atlassian Confluence Wiki hosted by CyVerse for several years to organize my lab materials. Those archived pages are [here](https://cyverse.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~tyson_swetnam/overview){target=_blank}

My second professional website is archived [here](https://tyson-swetnam.github.io/old_website){target=_blank}
