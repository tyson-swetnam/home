## Mexican Wolf Recovery

In 2016, in collaboration with the Arizona Game and Fish Department, and the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) I was involved in the planning and mapping of potential recovery areas for the critically endangeder Mexican Wolf. Our work is published in the [US Fish and Wildlife Service 2017 Species Recovery Plan Draft Report](https://www.fws.gov/southwest/es/mexicanwolf/pdf/20170622_DftBioReport_Appendices.pdf), and by work by my Mexican colleages at UNAM in 2021. 

## Remote Sensing on the Walnut Gulch & Santa Rita Experimental Range

A second post-doctoral appointment was supported by a funding agreement between The University of Arizona and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Southwest Watershed Research Center (SWRC) to study remote sensing of semi-arid grasslands on the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed (WGEW) and the Santa Rita Experimental Range (SRER). Both WGEW and SRER are Long Term Agricultural Research (LTAR) sites, SRER is also a NEON Core Site. 

## Critical Zone Observatory Networks

My post-doctoral research was supported by the NSF Critical Zone Observatories Network, where I worked in the Santa Catalina - Jemez Observatory

## US Forest Service Carbon Mapping

My Ph.D. was supported by the USDA Forest Service as a Student Temporary Employment Program (STEP). This work was documented in my dissertation, and resulted in five peer-reviewed manuscripts and one working paper.
