This project is addressing the challenge of providing distributed, scalable, and personalized training of cyberinfrastructures - systems that offer state-of-the-art cloud services for storing, sharing, and processing scientific data. Today, personalized training of these rapidly evolving, and hence relatively undocumented, systems requires trainer-supervised, hands-on use of these systems.

### Mexican Wolf Recovery

:material-compass-rose: :material-math-compass: :material-map: :material-map-clock: :material-map-marker-path: :material-language-r: 

In 2016, in collaboration with the Arizona Game and Fish Department, and the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) I was involved in the planning and mapping of potential recovery areas for the critically endangered Mexican Wolf. Our work is published in the [US Fish and Wildlife Service 2017 Species Recovery Plan Draft Report :fontawesome-solid-file-pdf:](https://www.fws.gov/southwest/es/mexicanwolf/pdf/20170622_DftBioReport_Appendices.pdf), and by my Mexican colleages at UNAM in 2021.

After my post-doc, I was supported by a funding agreement between The University of Arizona and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Southwest Watershed Research Center (SWRC) to study remote sensing of semi-arid grasslands on the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed (WGEW) and the Santa Rita Experimental Range (SRER). Both WGEW and SRER are Long Term Agricultural Research (LTAR) sites, SRER is also a NEON Core Site.
