If you're a student at University of Arizona, I am happy to meet up with you in-person or virtually to discuss your career.

Currently, I advise undergraduate and graduate students in Computer Science, Data Science, Natural Resource Management, Hydrology, Geography and Regional Development, Plant Sciences, and Bioinformatics.
